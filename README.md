# Driver-Drowsiness-Detection-System
#Driver drowsiness detection system .
# This is a project built/formed using face_recognition module and open cv 
#With the help of pure python as a backend language 


#Logic Or Reasoning behind the project:
#This project includes working with face recognition module and open cv ,,
#By detection of landmarks on the human face from which we can determine whether eyes are closed or opened.

#Working of the project:
#When the landmarks are detected , we are taking he rario of "sum of vertical landmarks euclidean distance divivded by twice the distance between horizontal landmarks."
#the thresold is set to 0.30
#whuch is totally dependent on your system,,, which you can configure or change for thresholds of drowsiness and activeness.
